##Crystal Collector##
* You will be given a new random number at the start.

* There are four crystals below. By clicking on a crystal, you will add a specific amount of points to your current score. 

* You win the game by matching your total score to the random target score. If your current score goes above the target score, you lose. 

* Each round will generate different values for the target score and crystals.

This project was aimed for practicing jQuery without relying too much on JavaScript
